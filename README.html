    <h1>Game Synopsis: Light</h1>
    <p>"Light" is an interactive game that simulates the journey of coping with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through a narrative-driven experience. Players make choices that reflect real-life PTSD responses and coping mechanisms, providing insights into the complexities of living with trauma.</p>
    <h2>Key Psychological Themes and Mechanisms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hyper-vigilance:</strong> The choice to sleep with the sword under the pillow versus putting it away symbolizes the hyper-vigilance often experienced by individuals with PTSD, where perceived threats influence behaviors meant to enhance safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance vs. Confrontation:</strong> Decisions to confront or avoid triggers, such as the approach towards noise or the creature, represent common coping strategies in PTSD, each with its own set of outcomes and emotional consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Therapeutic Narratives:</strong> The narrative paths where the player confronts fears or finds resolution are analogous to exposure therapy, a common treatment for PTSD that involves facing and processing fear-inducing objects or situations in a controlled manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbolic Representation of Trauma:</strong> The recurring scenarios and creatures serve as metaphors for traumatic memories, illustrating how PTSD can manifest as persistent and intrusive recollections that disrupt daily life.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Purpose and Value:</h2>
    <p>The game provides a valuable educational tool for understanding PTSD, demonstrating through interactive gameplay how psychological principles can be applied to real-life scenarios.
